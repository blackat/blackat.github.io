Docker is platform to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers.

**Containerization.**
{: .notice--info}

## Why Containeration

Containers are:

- Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
- Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
- Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.
- Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
- Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.
- Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.

__Watch out:__
Docker is lightweight w.r.t. a full virtual machine which does not share anything.

## Fundamentals: Images and Containers

An **image** is an *executable package*{: .italic-red-text}, it includes everything required to run an application: the code, a runtime libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.

A **container** is a *runtime instance of an image*{: .italic-red-text}.

> To turn an image into a container, the Docker engine takes the image, adds a read/write filesystem on top, and initializes various settings.

### Some Facts

[Guest OS:] an operating system secondary to the main OS installed on the machine knows as the *host operating system*{: .italic-red-text}. It provides an alternative OS for the device.

[Host:] a computer where a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machine.

[Hypervisor (Virtual Machine Monitor):] software, firmware or hardware able to run virtual machines. The VMM hides physical characteristic and presents instead an abstract computing platform to the guest operating system. Different operating system the virtualized hardware resources (x86 machine).

[Containerization (Operating-system-level virtualization)] operating system feature where the kernel, the part of the OS that has the complete control of everything in the system, allow multiple user-space instances called containers or partitions, or virtualization engines or jails.

### Container vs. Virtual Machines

A container runs natively on Linux and shares the kernel of the host machine with other containers. A container is like any other exceutable in terms of resources, it is lightweight.

A virtual machines instead runs a full *guest* operating system with virtual access to host resources via the hypervisor.

## Image
An image is:
- a set of layers
- is like a class in the OOP
- is like the recipe of a cake

### Images
__Properties:__
- an image is always _read only_ and _immutable_;

### Layers

__Properties:__
 - layers are additive so the resulting image could be quite large
******************** - only missing layers are downloaded

## Docker vs. Virtual Machine
- sharable layers


## Begin with commands
### Help commands
```bash
docker help              // display description of the available commands
docker help pull         // display all the information and option about the command 
```

### Image commands
Docker images are store as series of read-only layers [1].

```bash
docker images                             // display local images on your machine
docker rmi $(docker images -q)            // remove all the images on your machine
docker inspect                            // display low level information about an image
```
![image-center](/assets/images/posts/pragmatic-docker-101/docker-images.png){: height="70%" .align-center} 

#### Possible sequence

```bash
docker image                        // list all the commands
docker image COMMAND --help
docker images                       // list all the images
docker rm image [IMAGE...]          // remove an image by its ID
```

### Layer commands
```bash
docker history ubuntu                     // list the layers in a specific image
```

#### Import, Export and Squash command


#### Container commands
```bash
docker run -it ubuntu-latest /bin/bash
docker run -i -t -rm ubuntu-latest /bin/bash
docker container ls                                         // display all the running containers
docker container ls -a                                      // display all the containers irrespective of their state 
docker stop CONTAINER                                       // stop the container
docker stop $(docker ps -q)                                 // stop all the running containers
docker rm 
```
Docker turn the image into a container:
- then _image_ `ubuntu-latest` is pulled down from the `ubuntu` repository unless already locally available;
- add read/write layer on top of the layer's stack;
- initialize image name, ID, resource limits (CPU and memory), attache IP address from a pool;
- start the shell `/bin/bash` where the user can log in.

Docker captures and display the container output in the console, for this reason an interactive `bash` shell
is eventually started and presented to the user. Now the user can interact with it or simply run some commands
like `apt-get`.

Adding the option `-rm` we say to Docker we do not need the container after it has been stopped. The container
will be deleted from the file system.

__watch out__
Once the container is stopped all the settings and filesystem are saved, the read/write top layer; this is the
difference between a stopped container and its image.

__Properties:__
- the top layer of a container is always writable, it is the _read/wrire layer_;
- changes are applied to the _top layer only_;
- the file system of the top layer is the _union filesystem_ of the underlying layers;

### Create an image from a running container
Possible but better option is the `Dockerfile`.

#### Example of sequence
##### Run a container based on ubuntu linux image
```bash
blackat:~ eugenio$ docker run ubuntu:latest
Unable to find image 'ubuntu:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/ubuntu
8f7c85c2269a: Pull complete 
9e72e494a6dd: Pull complete 
3009ec50c887: Pull complete 
9d5ffccbec91: Pull complete 
e872a2642ce1: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:d3fdf5b1f8e8a155c17d5786280af1f5a04c10e95145a515279cf17abdf0191f
Status: Downloaded newer image ubuntu:latest
```

##### List all the container
```bash
blackat:~ eugenio$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED              STATUS                          PORTS               NAMES
0441ab22d007        ubuntu:latest       "/bin/bash"         About a minute ago   Exited (0) About a minute ago                       silly_sinoussi
```
The image has been downloded and the conatiner, instance of the downloaded image, has been instantiated, but it has
been stopped immediately after. 

##### Run a container and present the bash interpreter
```bash
blackat:~ eugenio$ docker run -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
root@144a243cd5fc:/# 
```
We have added the command that must be executed after the container has been started, bash interpreter is started 
and presented to the user.

##### Display all the alive container
```bash
blackat:~ eugenio$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED              STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
144a243cd5fc        ubuntu:latest       "/bin/bash"         About a minute ago   Up About a minute                       zealous_kare
```
Now the container stays _up_.

##### Stop the container
```bash
blackat:~ eugenio$ docker stop 144a243cd5fc
144a243cd5fc
```
The container `144a243cd5fc` has been stopped, so all the settings, filesystem changes and the read/write layer 
on top will be retain, but the processes have been stop and the memory content has gone.

##### List all the containers
```bash
blackat:~ eugenio$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                    PORTS               NAMES
144a243cd5fc        ubuntu:latest       "/bin/bash"         11 hours ago        Exited (0) 2 hours ago                        zealous_kare
0441ab22d007        ubuntu:latest       "/bin/bash"         11 hours ago        Exited (0) 11 hours ago                       silly_sinoussi
```

##### Stop and remove all the containers
```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

##### Remove all the images (once containers have been removed)
```bash
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
```

```bash
docker rmi $(docker images -f "dangling=true" -q)
```


## First Dockerfile
Create a `Dockerfile` to pull Ubuntu Linux and install Oracle JDK 64 bit.

```bash
docker build -t ubuntu_java
```
`-t` used to tag the image

Create the container instance of the just created image

```bash
docker run -name linux_java_instance -i -t linux_java
```
setting the name allows to avoid to deal with very complex IDs.

##### Build the image
Build the image:
```bash
blackat:docker-pragmatic-101 eugenio$ docker build -t docker-java .
...
Successfully built 0835ad8a56fd
Successfully tagged ubuntu-full-platform:latest
```

Display all the images:
```bash
blackat:docker-pragmatic-101 eugenio$ docker images
REPOSITORY             TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
ubuntu-full-platform   latest              0835ad8a56fd        38 seconds ago      849MB
ubuntu                 17.10               26d147d2310f        7 days ago          96.6MB
```

Run the container instance of the just created image:
```bash
blackat:docker-pragmatic-101 eugenio$ run -it ubuntu-full-platform
root@be56d4fc8933:/#
```

Once `exit` from the container, it will stopped, to resume (and stop)
```bash
docker start be56d4fc8933      // docker stop be56d4fc8933
docker attach be56d4fc8933     // attach local standard input, output, and error streams to a running container
```
