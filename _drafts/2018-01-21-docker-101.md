# In a Nutshell
Docker is

__Watch out:__
Docker is lightweight w.r.t. a full virtual machine which does not share anything.

### Images
__Properties:__
- an image is always _read only_ and _immutable_;

### Layers

__Properties:__
 - layers are additive so the resulting image could be quite large
******************** - only missing layers are downloaded

## Docker vs. Virtual Machine
- sharable layers


## Begin with commands
### Help commands
```bash
docker help              // display description of the available commands
docker help pull         // display all the information and option about the command 
```

### Image commands
Docker images are store as series of read-only layers [1].

```bash
docker images                             // display local images on your machine
docker rmi $(docker images -q)            // remove all the images on your machine
docker inspect                            // display low level information about an image
```
![image-center](/assets/images/posts/pragmatic-docker-101/docker-images.png){: height="70%" .align-center} 

#### Possible sequence

```bash
docker image                        // list all the commands
docker image COMMAND --help
docker images                       // list all the images
docker rm image [IMAGE...]          // remove an image by its ID
```

### Layer commands
```bash
docker history ubuntu                     // list the layers in a specific image
```

#### Import, Export and Squash command

### Containers
A running instance of an image is called __container__ [1]. You can think an image is a class and the container 
is the running instance.

#### Container commands
```bash
docker run -it ubuntu-latest /bin/bash
docker run -i -t -rm ubuntu-latest /bin/bash
docker container ls                                         // display all the running containers
docker container ls -a                                      // display all the containers irrespective of their state 
docker stop CONTAINER                                       // stop the container
docker stop $(docker ps -q)                                 // stop all the running containers
docker rm 
```
Docker turn the image into a container:
- then _image_ `ubuntu-latest` is pulled down from the `ubuntu` repository unless already locally available;
- add read/write layer on top of the layer's stack;
- initialize image name, ID, resource limits (CPU and memory), attache IP address from a pool;
- start the shell `/bin/bash` where the user can log in.

Docker captures and display the container output in the console, for this reason an interactive `bash` shell
is eventually started and presented to the user. Now the user can interact with it or simply run some commands
like `apt-get`.

Adding the option `-rm` we say to Docker we do not need the container after it has been stopped. The container
will be deleted from the file system.

__watch out__
Once the container is stopped all the settings and filesystem are saved, the read/write top layer; this is the
difference between a stopped container and its image.

__Properties:__
- the top layer of a container is always writable, it is the _read/wrire layer_;
- changes are applied to the _top layer only_;
- the file system of the top layer is the _union filesystem_ of the underlying layers;

### Create an image from a running container
Possible but better option is the `Dockerfile`.

#### Example of sequence
##### Run a container based on ubuntu linux image
```bash
blackat:~ eugenio$ docker run ubuntu:latest
Unable to find image 'ubuntu:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/ubuntu
8f7c85c2269a: Pull complete 
9e72e494a6dd: Pull complete 
3009ec50c887: Pull complete 
9d5ffccbec91: Pull complete 
e872a2642ce1: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:d3fdf5b1f8e8a155c17d5786280af1f5a04c10e95145a515279cf17abdf0191f
Status: Downloaded newer image ubuntu:latest
```

##### List all the container
```bash
blackat:~ eugenio$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED              STATUS                          PORTS               NAMES
0441ab22d007        ubuntu:latest       "/bin/bash"         About a minute ago   Exited (0) About a minute ago                       silly_sinoussi
```
The image has been downloded and the conatiner, instance of the downloaded image, has been instantiated, but it has
been stopped immediately after. 

##### Run a container and present the bash interpreter
```bash
blackat:~ eugenio$ docker run -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
root@144a243cd5fc:/# 
```
We have added the command that must be executed after the container has been started, bash interpreter is started 
and presented to the user.

##### Display all the alive container
```bash
blackat:~ eugenio$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED              STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
144a243cd5fc        ubuntu:latest       "/bin/bash"         About a minute ago   Up About a minute                       zealous_kare
```
Now the container stays _up_.

##### Stop the container
```bash
blackat:~ eugenio$ docker stop 144a243cd5fc
144a243cd5fc
```
The container `144a243cd5fc` has been stopped, so all the settings, filesystem changes and the read/write layer 
on top will be retain, but the processes have been stop and the memory content has gone.

##### List all the containers
```bash
blackat:~ eugenio$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                    PORTS               NAMES
144a243cd5fc        ubuntu:latest       "/bin/bash"         11 hours ago        Exited (0) 2 hours ago                        zealous_kare
0441ab22d007        ubuntu:latest       "/bin/bash"         11 hours ago        Exited (0) 11 hours ago                       silly_sinoussi
```

##### Stop and remove all the containers
```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

##### Remove all the images (once containers have been removed)
```bash
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
```

```bash
docker rmi $(docker images -f "dangling=true" -q)
```


## First Dockerfile
Create a `Dockerfile` to pull Ubuntu Linux and install Oracle JDK 64 bit.

```bash
docker build -t ubuntu_java
```
`-t` used to tag the image

Create the container instance of the just created image

```bash
docker run -name linux_java_instance -i -t linux_java
```
setting the name allows to avoid to deal with very complex IDs.

##### Build the image
Build the image:
```bash
blackat:docker-pragmatic-101 eugenio$ docker build -t docker-java .
...
Successfully built 0835ad8a56fd
Successfully tagged ubuntu-full-platform:latest
```

Display all the images:
```bash
blackat:docker-pragmatic-101 eugenio$ docker images
REPOSITORY             TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
ubuntu-full-platform   latest              0835ad8a56fd        38 seconds ago      849MB
ubuntu                 17.10               26d147d2310f        7 days ago          96.6MB
```

Run the container instance of the just created image:
```bash
blackat:docker-pragmatic-101 eugenio$ run -it ubuntu-full-platform
root@be56d4fc8933:/#
```

Once `exit` from the container, it will stopped, to resume (and stop)
```bash
docker start be56d4fc8933      // docker stop be56d4fc8933
docker attach be56d4fc8933     // attach local standard input, output, and error streams to a running container
```

XXX how to know the image from a container an viceversa????
